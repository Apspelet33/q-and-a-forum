## q&a forum!

## Description
Made this project in education purpose and to have something to show in my portfolio.
I copied parts of stackoverflows design but it is not meant to be a pixel perfect clone in any way.

## Stack
This project was made using mongodb, nextjs as frontend & backend and scss for styling.
For a more simple auth system i used next-auth due to it being easy to implement in mongodb with an adapter.

## Info
Feel free to fork or "steal" code from the project as you please no need to give any credit.
But if you find any bugs or errors please report them to me at: williameliasson5@gmail.com
